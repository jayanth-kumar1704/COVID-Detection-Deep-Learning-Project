#COVID-Detection-Deep-Learning-Project

The COVID Detection Deep Learning Project utilized advanced machine learning techniques to develop a highly accurate and automated system for identifying COVID-19 cases from medical
imaging data, such as X-rays and CT scans. This project involved training deep neural networks to recognize distinctive patterns associated with COVID-19 lung manifestations.
The resulting model demonstrated remarkable accuracy, offering a valuable tool to assist healthcare providers in swift and reliable COVID-19 diagnosis, ultimately aiding in 
the timely treatment and containment of the virus.
